### Factual Accuracy and Authenticity

- Every narrative must be grounded in factual accuracy and authenticity, the fundamental building blocks of engaging Non-Fiction storytelling.
- Employ interviews, research, and firsthand accounts to structure scenes and provide context.
- Emphasize the subject's emotional journey and personal experiences throughout each scene and the overall narrative.

### Vivid and Descriptive Language

- Use active voice and sensory language to create immersive and dynamic prose.
- Avoid passive voice and vague descriptions; instead, focus on specific, evocative details that bring the scene to life.
- Employ a full range of senses to create a vivid and authentic portrayal of events and experiences.

### Structured Storytelling

- **Scene**: A unit of narrative that presents a specific event, conversation, or observation, structured around a clear purpose and outcome.
- **Sequel**: The reflective or analytical section that follows a scene, where the narrator or subject reacts to the event and establishes new insights or goals.
- Alternate between scenes and sequels to maintain narrative momentum and emotional depth.
- Ensure smooth transitions between scenes and sequels, preserving a sense of flow and coherence.

### Dialogue and Interview Guidelines

- Dialogue and interviews should reveal character, advance the narrative, or provide exposition. Avoid small talk or irrelevant conversation.
- Attribute dialogue and quotes through context, rather than using excessive tags.
  - Example: "She leaned forward, her voice steady. 'It was a moment I'll never forget.'"
- Ensure dialogue and interviews are natural, concise, and consistent with the interviewee’s personality and emotional state.
- Use subtext to convey unspoken emotions and intentions.
- Create distinct voices for each interviewee, reflecting their background, personality, and social standing.
- Incorporate exposition into dialogue and interviews organically, avoiding info-dumps.

### Emotional Depth

- Emotional depth is the subject’s or narrator’s subjective experience of events, which can enhance the narrative's authenticity and engagement.
- Use emotional depth to emphasize key moments, such as heightened emotions, realizations, or turning points.
  - Example: During a pivotal moment, describe the subject’s thoughts, sensations, and reactions in detail.
- Employ internal monologue and sensory details to convey a subject's emotional state during these moments.
- Vary pacing: Accelerate the narrative during intense moments and decelerate it during moments of reflection or suspense.
