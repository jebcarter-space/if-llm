The Library is a room. "The small town library is a cozy, quiet place with worn wooden shelves and a faint scent of old books. Dust motes dance in the shafts of sunlight slanting through the windows. A librarian's desk sits near the front door, cluttered with overdue notices and coffee mugs."

The Key is a key. "A tarnished brass key, worn smooth with age."

The Drawer is a container in the Librarian's Desk. "A small, dusty drawer." The Drawer contains The Key.

The Safe is in the Librarian's Desk. "A small, locked safe sits behind the librarian's computer. A faded label reads 'Confidential Files'." The Safe is locked.

The Book is in the Safe. "A large, leather-bound book with ornate gold lettering. The title is barely visible beneath a layer of dust, but appears to be 'The History of Hollow Creek'." The Book is not readable.

The Librarian's Desk is a piece of furniture. "A worn wooden desk cluttered with papers, pens, and various office supplies. A computer monitor is off to one side."

The Librarian is a person. "The librarian is a small, elderly woman with glasses and a neat bun. She wears a cardigan and sensible shoes. She looks perpetually tired but kind."
