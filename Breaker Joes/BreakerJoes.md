# BREAKER JOES - Space Detective Adventures!

## What's so Cool about Character Creation?

1. Give yourself a cool FUTURISTIC name, and describe what you look like.
2. You've got some stuff! Write it down, be specific:
   - Some SPACE clothes or armor!
   - A HIGH-TECH weapon!
   - A SOPHISTICATED tool!
   - A personal MEMENTO FROM SPACE!
   - Another COOL thing!

3. You used to have a job - IN SPACE! What category was it from and what was it, specifically?
   - Criminal, Military, Science, Civilian, Technical or Weird

4. You have some outstanding QUALITY - perhaps you are Fit, Handy, Sharp, Cool, or just Weird in a good way? What is it? You can use the tables below for reference or inspiration. If you want to take a second positive Quality, roll or choose a Negative Quality as well. If you choose a Negative Quality and want to take a second one, also roll or choose a Positive Quality.
5. You're good at some stuff. Pick a SKILL from the grouping matching your background below (Criminals use the Teamster listing), plus another one reflecting your training as a Break Consultant. Finally, make up a third one reflecting your character's specific background and personality. Folks who had Weird Jobs can choose one from any table for their training and make up two others.
6. You have some SCORES that measure your capability. Assign three points however you like between:
    -Body:
        Description: Represents the character's physical capabilities, including strength, agility, endurance, and overall health.
        Usage: Affects skills and actions related to physical tasks, combat, athleticism, and resilience against physical harm.

   - Mind:
        Description: Encompasses the character's mental acuity, intelligence, perception, and problem-solving abilities.
        Usage: Influences skills and actions involving knowledge, reasoning, investigation, and technological aptitude.

    -Soul:
        Description: Reflects the character's spiritual fortitude, willpower, charisma, and emotional resilience.
        Usage: Impacts skills and actions related to social interactions, leadership, psychological resilience, and resistance to mental or emotional stress.

7. You're not just any schmuck - take 1 LUCK.
8. Finally, work through your characters Thoughts and Belief here: catastrophe_single_page.pdf

## Who cares about Experience Anyway?

By default, your characters will start as Rookies, who have completed their training to be Break Consultants. For each Mission you go on (regardless of outcome) you will get to mark experience, and when you get enough you can RANK UP and gain additional Skills, improve your Scores, and increase your LUCK.

| Rank | Missions to Rank Up |
| :-- | :-- |
| Rookie | 1 |
| Pro | 2 |
| Ace | 3 |
| Vet | 4 |
| Legend | 5 |

### Ranking Up

Each time you complete the number of missions needed to get to the next RANK, during your next downtime do the following:

- Increase a Score by +1
- Increase your Luck by 1.
- Learn an additional Skill from the lists or create one of your own.
- If you are becoming an Ace or a Legend, take another pair of Negative and Positive Qualities.
- If you are becoming a Pro or Vet, take an additional Thought and Belief slot, and roll an additional d6 when determining your Belief points.

### Using Luck

By spending a point of LUCK you can achieve the following effects.

- Ignore all of the Hits from a given attack!
- Double the Hits you are doing from a given attack!
- Make a Hit you otherwise couldn't due to lack of equipment or ability!
- Bend the truth of the world in your favor and get a lucky break!

## What's so Neat about Gearing Up?

When you go out on a Mission, decide how much LOADOUT you are bringing along. Having too much stuff can be a Disadvantage to moving around or reacting quickly, but not having something you need can be an even worse Disadvantage!

Your equipment is split between your PACK and your GEAR. The PACK contains specialty equipment, medicine, heavy tools, and supplies. Its also where you will store anything you LOOT on Missions.

Your GEAR is your action-oriented stuff like weapons, your basic rig, or small tools and computers.

### Load Limits

| Speed | Pack Limit | Gear Limit |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Very Fast | 2 | 1 |
| Fast | 3 | 2 |
| Normal | 5 | 3 |
| Slow | 8 | 5 |

### PACK Items

- First Aid
- Food & Water
- Parts
- Repair Kit
- Tech Kit
- Explosives
- Climbing Gear
- Heavy Tools
- Bio-Sampler
- Jet pack
- Environmental Suit
- Loot

### GEAR Items

- Rig: Communicator, flashlight, zip ties, Glow sticks, lighter, multi-tool (counts as one)
- Personal Item (special equipment with active effects)
- Armor (1 unit per point of protection)
- Shield (1 unit per point of protection, easily transferred or dropped)
- Weapons (1 unit per Hit of damage, +1 per Special quality)
- Grenades
- Scanner
- Gas mask
- Lockpicks
- Datapad
- Cyberdeck
- Tools

## Money and Loot

Breaker Joes don't need to track every little piece of equipment and penny spent. Most equipment is requisitioned when going on Missions and a reasonable attrition rate is expected. Some equipment is specialized, dangerous enough, or just outside of the remit of the agency that Breakers will want to supply their own. Additionally, when between contracts Breakers are only supplied with Basic rations and accommodations in Agency facilities. Anything else they want they will need to pay for from their personal Credits.

One CREDIT is the smallest unit of tracked currency and represents a substantial amount of money.

### Things Worth One Credit

- A light weapon
- A substantial bribe
- An opulent night out, including food, entertainment, and lodging
- A few weeks rent in a mid-range apartment

### More Expensive Things

- A new space suit, 3C
- A medium weapon, 2C
- A heavy weapon, 5C
- Passage to another world, 7C
- Passage to a nearby star system, 12C
- Average ground car, 25C
- A Starship upgrade, 50C
- Simple helicopter, 75C
- Hover tank, 200C
- New, bare-bones Starship, 500C
- A small space station, 5000C
- A TransStar facility, 50000C

## Pay and Expenses

Base PAYOUT for each Agency Mission is equal to your collective Rank and appropriate Scores, summed amongst all Breakers signing on. Additional Payout can be received for performing exceptionally well or completing side objectives or missions provided by the Agency. Payout for freelance missions is negotiated between the Breakers and the prospective client.

The Breakers are given a BUDGET equal to the Payout for incidental expenses, damages, and the like. Any non-consumable Loadout not returned after a Mission beyond this Budget and any heavy collateral damages accrue as DEBT divided amongst the Breakers.

LOOT taken from Mission sites can be converted to Credits or offset Debt as long as it either belonged to the Mission targets, was given by the Mission clients, or otherwise doesn't clearly belong to The Public.

## How to Do Stuff in Outer Space

When you attempt to do something uncertain or risky (like shoot an enemy, avoid getting shot, kick down a door, hack a mainframe, or calm someone down):

1. Tell everyone what you're trying to do and how you're trying to do it.
2. Roll two six sided dice.
3. Add your relevant SCORE +1 for each ADVANTAGE you have. Like:
   - A HIGH-TECH weapon!
   - A SOPHISTICATED tool!
   - A relevant skill!
   - Professional experience!
   - A relevant Quality!
   - A good position!

4. -1 for each DISADVANTAGE you have. Like:
   - No weapon or appropriate tools!
   - Your in a bad position!
   - Your opponent has SPACE armor or a HIGH-TECH weapon!
   - An unhelpful Quality!
   - You're really far away!
   - You've been Hit!

5. Generally, you need an 8+ to succeed, but that number may be higher or lower depending on the circumstances. Doubles mean something special happens!

## The Gore Die

In the spirit of the Weird Scifi Horror Space Adventure OVA strain of influences, I present the Gore Die:

When you are engaged in ARMED COMBAT with an enemy, you may choose to replace one of your 2d6 with the GORE DIE. The higher this die rolls, the messier, bloodier, gorier, and nastier your Hit is. Even a bloodspraying messy Hit won't Take Out an opponent if they have any Hits left, though they may concede and will definitely be taking additional DISADVANTAGES on their next roll, will take longer to recover from the Hit, and may impact their movement, equipment, special abilities, and the like. Landing a gory hit will probably require any equal or lower ranked enemies to take check their NERVE.

If an enemy is on their last Hit (regardless of Armor, even if they only have one Hit) add +3 to the Gore Die's roll when checking the table.

You can always choose not to use the Gore die, reflecting holding back, controlling your fire, and the like - unless you are using a particularly nasty weapon like a beam sword, a shotgun, a chainsaw, a cyberfist or the like.

Oh, and it goes without saying that the enemy gets to use the Gore die too, if they want to.

### Gore Table

(+3 when on final Hit)

| Die Roll | Effect |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | drop weapons, superficial wounds, hits that knock the wind out of you, stumble, bruises, stuns, knockdowns |
| 2 | dislocations, shattered weapons, numb limbs |
| 3 | incapacitated limbs, deep wounds, smashed teeth, broken bones |
| 4 | severed arteries, internal bleeding, spine injuries, gouged out eyes |
| 5 | half a limb lost, organs ruptured |
| 6 | entire limb lost, body parts hacked in half |
| 7 | Texas Chainsaw Massacre, flying body parts, what a mess |

## How to Get Hurt in Outer Space

### Hits come in Three Types!

**PHYSICAL Hits** affect your body, health, augmentations and so on. Like:
- You're hypoxic!
- You've been laser-burned!
- Your mechanical arm is jammed!

**MENTAL Hits** affect your mind, soul, spirit, and so forth. Like:
- You're in a psychically induced fugue!
- You're intimated by the enemy!
- You're shook up and can't remember how to use a skill!

**SOCIAL Hits** affect your status in interpersonal relationships, organizations, cultures, and so on. Like:
- You're super embarrassed!
- You'e been reprimanded for insubordination against your leader!
- Your reputation precedes you, but not the one you want.

### Hits are Disadvantages!

Each Hit gives you a -1 to roll when it applies. Always write each injury with a specific description which should suggest what kinds of actions the injury complicates. A Gory Hit counts for TWO disadvantages each, at a minimum.

### Armor absorbs Hits!

For each point of Armor you are wearing, you can ignore one Hit from a single attack. Generally, Armor above 2 points is extremely uncommon and advanced.

### Luck can Protect You!

If your character has gained LUCK from improving their Rank, you can mark ANY TYPE of hit against LUCK instead, including Gory Hits. These LUCK hits won't recover until you are between Missions again.

### You can only take So Much!

You can have at most THREE HITS OF A GIVEN TYPE - physical, mental, or social - at any one time.

If you take a fourth Hit of one type before recovering, you are TAKEN OUT! The character who took you out decides what happens to you now. It might be:

**PHYSICAL**
- Unconscious!
- Sedated!
- Restrained!
- Exhausted!
- Transformed!
- Frozen!
- Dead!

**MENTAL**
- Stupefied!
- Possessed!
- Uploaded!
- Confused!
- Beguiled!
- Convinced!
- Dead!

**SOCIAL**
- Demoted!
- Exiled!
- Dishonored!
- Conscripted!
- Arrested!
- Converted!
- Dead!

If you've taken multiple Hits, you might want to CONCEDE! If you conceded, you still get TAKEN OUT! but you are the one who decides how. That includes GETTING AWAY! Whatever you decide, explain how it makes sense and happens!

## What's so Great about Big Mecha and Cool Starships?

To make a hardsuit, mecha, or starship:

1. How big is it? Hardsuit, Forklift, Bus, or Starship (anything bigger is a Location more than it is a Mecha)
2. How fast is it? Zoom on the ground, blast through the sky, or race comets?
3. What type of weapons? Gatling lasers, rayguns, railguns, laser blades, missile launchers, etc.
4. Describe its appearance: How can people tell its your mecha? What stands out about it?
5. Write down 2 MODS: these are things your mecha has been modified to do well and give special abilities and ADVANTAGE when applicable. Deep scanners, escape pods, stealth mode, sundiving, hyper-mobility, etc.

### Mecha Rules

- Each Mecha has 20 FUEL cells.
- Each FUEL spent adds +1 to your roll.
- When empty, the mecha can't fight, it can only move. -2 Disadvantage to doing anything other than moving.
- REFUEL at a charger, starport, or similar station depending on the mecha.
- Mecha have their own MECHA HITS depending on their size. Generally, only Mecha scale weapons can harm Mecha, but psychic powers, strange anomalies, or ridiculous Personal Equipment may bridge that gap.

### Mecha Hits

| Mecha scale | Hits |
| :-- | :-- |
| Hardsuit | 3 |
| Forklift | 5 |
| Bus | 7 |
| Starship | 9 |
