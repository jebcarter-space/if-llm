    Body:
        Description: Represents the character's physical capabilities, including strength, agility, endurance, and overall health.
        Usage: Affects skills and actions related to physical tasks, combat, athleticism, and resilience against physical harm.

    Mind:
        Description: Encompasses the character's mental acuity, intelligence, perception, and problem-solving abilities.
        Usage: Influences skills and actions involving knowledge, reasoning, investigation, and technological aptitude.

    Soul:
        Description: Reflects the character's spiritual fortitude, willpower, charisma, and emotional resilience.
        Usage: Impacts skills and actions related to social interactions, leadership, psychological resilience, and resistance to mental or emotional stress.

Implementation

    Point Allocation: Players assign three points among Body, Mind, and Soul, with each score having a minimum of 1 point. This allows for customization based on the character's strengths and playstyle.

    Mechanical Integration: These scores can be used to determine the effectiveness of related skills and actions, providing bonuses or penalties based on the character's focus. For example, a high Body score might grant bonuses to physical combat and athletic feats, while a high Soul score could enhance social influence and resistance to fear or intimidation.

    Role-Playing Opportunities: The Body/Mind/Soul split encourages players to think about their characters holistically, considering not just physical and mental capabilities, but also their spiritual and emotional dimensions. This can lead to richer role-playing experiences and more nuanced character development.

Example

    A character with a high Body score might be a formidable warrior or athlete, excelling in physical challenges and combat.
    A character with a high Mind score could be a brilliant scientist or strategist, adept at solving puzzles and navigating complex systems.
    A character with a high Soul score might be a charismatic leader or spiritual guide, capable of inspiring others and remaining steadfast in the face of adversity.
