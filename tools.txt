```MarienburgTable
A total of 6 or less is a Failure; things donâ€™t go well, and the
GM will describe the consequences.
A total of 7 - 9 is a Problem; you do it, but there is some
cost, compromise, retribution, harm, etc.
A total of 10 - 11 is a Success; you do it without any
complications.
A total of 12+ is a Critical; you do it perfectly and receive
some extra benefit or advantage
