To determine if Alice can see John, we need to check if there is a clear line of sight between their positions on the map. A clear line of sight means that there are no walls (ww) blocking the path between Alice's position (1) and John's position (2).

Let's analyze the map:

w,w,w,w,w,w
w, ,1, , ,w
w, , , , ,w

w, ,2, , ,w

    Alice is at position (1, 2).
    John is at position (6, 2).

We need to check if there is a straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that connects these two positions without any walls in between.

Let's check the possible lines of sight:

    Vertically: There are walls between rows 2 and 6 in column 2.
    Horizontally: They are not in the same row.
    Diagonally: Check if any diagonal path is clear.

Let's verify if there's any clear diagonal path using code.

Alice can see John.

Can alice see John?


----
n the given Nethack screenshot representation, the characters are represented by the symbols @ for the player and 1 and 2 for other characters or monsters.

To determine if Alice (represented by 1) can see John (represented by 2), we need to check if there is a clear line of sight between them. This means there should be no walls (#) blocking the path between their positions.

Let's analyze the map:

#######@########

    Alice (1) is located at the second row, first column.
    John (2) is located at the tenth row, ninth column.

To check if Alice can see John, we need to trace a path from Alice's position to John's position. If there are any walls (#) in the direct line of sight, then Alice cannot see John.

Let's check the direct line of sight:

    From Alice's position (second row, first column) to John's position (tenth row, ninth column), there are multiple walls (#) in between.

Since there are walls blocking the direct path, Alice cannot see John.
